Welcome to the Visual Music Representation application. 

The following program allows you to visualize the repetitions in the notes and melodies of songs using self-similarity matrices.
It reads XML music documents and creates a matrix with the all the notes in order, aligned on the top horizontal axis with their 
respective duration and on the also on the left vertical axis. This creates an array where squares of colour are drawn at the position
in the matrix where the notes on the horizontal and vertical axis are the same.

As mentioned before, an XML document of the song you wish to analyse is required. The steps to getting an XML document from the online website 
Musescore can be found on the Medium article of the application: https://medium.com/@fil4444/d796aeed567 

One important thing to note is that the G4P library which is implemented in the sketch from the files manually. To do so, you must go into 
the libraries folder inside the VMR folder. Then, continue your path into the G4P file, where you will select the library folder where you 
will find the G4P file of the library. You must select the G4P.jar file and drag it into the sketch. The code will then be all set.

We would like to thank our teacher Mr. Patrick St. Amant for supporting us during this project. Moreover, this project was based off 
the project made by Colin Morris who wrote a similar program for the repetitions in the lyrics of pop songs. You can go check out his
