## What's VMR?

Welcome to the Visual Music Representation application. The following program allows you to visualize the repetitions in the notes and melodies of songs using self-similarity matrices. It reads XML music documents and creates a matrix with the all the notes in order, aligned on the top horizontal axis with their respective duration and on the also on the left vertical axis. This creates an array where squares of color are drawn at the position in the matrix where the notes on the horizontal and vertical axis are the same. The following [link](https://github.com/yaeldemers/Visual-Music-Representation) will take you to the GitHub page to download the files required to run the program. 

As mentioned before, an XML document of the song you wish to analyze is required. The steps to getting an XML document from the online website Musescore can be found in the [Medium article of the application]().

### Credits
We would like to thank our discrete mathematics teacher Mr. Patrick St.Amant for supporting us during this project.

Moreover, this project was based off the project made by Colin Morris who wrote a similar program for the repetitions in the lyrics of pop songs. You can go check out his project on his [github page](https://colinmorris.github.io/SongSim/#/gallery).
